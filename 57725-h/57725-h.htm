<p class="tb">Kitty Hawk and Kill Devil Hills are American place names
that will live in history. Here Wilbur and Orville Wright,
two unassuming brothers with a passion for advancing aeronautical
knowledge, and the willingness to undertake a scientific adventure,
made the world&rsquo;s first successful flight of a man-carrying,
power-driven, heavier-than-air machine.</p>
<p>December 17, 1903, was the day man first flew in this machine.
It was a cold and windy day when Orville Wright climbed aboard
their plane at 10:35 a.m. His first power-driven flight of 120 feet
lasted just 12 seconds when he flew over a wind-swept stretch of
level sand now preserved at Wright Brothers National Memorial.
From those moments the science of aeronautics has borne the
impress of the Wrights&rsquo; achievements.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><i>The Wright Brothers of Dayton, Ohio</i></span></h2>
<p>The two young men who were to be the first to fly were born in
the midwest shortly after the Civil War. Wilbur Wright was born
on a farm near Millville, 8 miles east of New Castle, Ind., April
16, 1867. Four years younger, Orville Wright was born in Dayton,
Ohio, August 19, 1871. They were the sons of Rev. Milton Wright,
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
a minister, and later bishop, of the United Brethren Church, and
Susan Koerner Wright. Both parents had been teachers. When
his sons were small, Bishop Wright was editor of the church&rsquo;s publications.
Mrs. Wright had &ldquo;a streak of her father&rsquo;s mechanical
ability,&rdquo; and she had a reputation in the family for being able &ldquo;to
mend anything.&rdquo; Bishop and Mrs. Wright also had two older sons,
Reuchlin and Lorin, and a younger daughter, Katharine.</p>
<p>In the Wright home, children were encouraged to pursue intellectual
interests and to investigate whatever aroused their curiosity.
Wilbur and Orville displayed mechanical aptitude, the gift of original
thinking, and a pioneering urge. Sharing a common interest
in mechanical devices, the boys made kites and toy helicopters, built
a lathe and a printing press that worked. Wilbur wrote of their
close associations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the time we were little children my brother Orville and myself
lived together, played together, worked together and, in fact, thought
together. We usually owned all our toys in common, talked over our
thoughts and aspirations so that nearly everything that was done in
our lives has been the result of conversations, suggestions and discussions
between us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Wright died in 1889. It was that year that the brothers assembled
their printing press from old parts found in junk yards and
barns and began to publish a successful neighborhood weekly newspaper.
Although each brother attended high school the full time
required for a diploma, neither of them formally graduated from
high school or attended college. Their two older brothers married
and established homes of their own, but Wilbur and Orville remained
bachelors. After completing their schooling they continued to live
with their father and schoolteacher sister in a modest framehouse in
Dayton.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>Young Business Partners</i></span></h2>
<p>Wilbur and Orville formed the Wright Cycle Company in 1892 to
sell bicycles. Business increased, and they soon found that they
needed to add a repair shop. Moderately successful, both in selling
new bicycles and general repairing, the brothers twice moved their
expanding business to larger quarters. As a next step they began
to manufacture bicycles. They called their first bicycle the &ldquo;Van
Cleve&rdquo; after their pioneer ancestors; a later model manufactured was
named the &ldquo;St. Clair&rdquo;; and finally they made a low-priced model
known as the &ldquo;Wright Special.&rdquo; They manufactured several hundred
bicycles of their own brand before discontinuing the business
in order to devote their full time to aviation.</p>
<p>Inseparable companions in business and personal life, the brothers
shared everything from a joint bank account to their laboratory work
while unraveling the problems of flight. They were not longfaced
and dour; both were sprightly and humor-loving. They loved small
children and dogs, and they played musical instruments, sang, and
enjoyed practical jokes.</p>

<p>The bicycle business provided the funds for the Wrights&rsquo; work in
aviation, and afforded them sufficient leisure to pursue their interest
in flying. Their father gave each of his children $1,000. This Wilbur
and Orville invested in stock and never drew on for their aviation
work&mdash;but it was there in case of necessity. They were never
financed by anyone.</p>
<p>The repair and manufacture of bicycles sharpened the brothers&rsquo;
mechanical skill. The enterprise also developed their business experience,
helpful later when they took the lead in founding the aviation
industry. In their construction of flying machines, Wilbur
and Orville often used the same equipment and tools used in repairing
bicycles. They conducted many of their scientific experiments
in the backroom of their shop, and most of the parts used in the
first successful airplane were built there.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><i>Pioneers of Flight</i></span></h2>
<p>Since the dawn of history the idea of human flight has intrigued
mankind. As the influence of the Wrights&rsquo; achievements will last
far into the future, so will the contributions of aeronautical pioneers
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
who probed the mysteries of flight before Wilbur and Orville solved
the problem. The research of these imaginative pioneer investigators
influenced the brothers. In studying those earlier works the
Wrights found many points that interested them. The knowledge
that other pioneers had shared their faith in the possibility of
heavier-than-air flight helped their morale.</p>

</div>
<p>In the pioneers&rsquo; direct line of descent from the Greek legend of
Daedalus and Icarus to the Wrights is Leonardo da Vinci. Da Vinci
drew some interesting sketches in the late 15th century, though a
machine built from his drawings could not possibly have flown.
The interest in England of Sir George Cayley influenced other men
to undertake the problem.</p>
<p>A Frenchman, Alphonse P&eacute;naud experimented with toy helicopters,
using twisted rubber bands for motive power. It was a P&eacute;naud
toy helicopter, given to Wilbur and Orville by their father, that
first stirred their childhood interest in flying. However, in Europe,
most experimenters had turned from heavier-than-air machines to
lighter-than-air dirigible balloons by the time the brothers took up
the problem of heavier-than-air flight. The American-born Sir Hiram
Maxim, after spending $100,000, had abandoned his work; the machine
built by Cl&eacute;ment Ader, at the expense of the French Government,
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
had been a failure. None of the early experimenters attained
sufficient knowledge of the aerodynamic principles involved to be
able to design a successful powered machine capable of free, controlled,
and sustained flight.</p>

<p class="pcap">Otto Lilienthal (1848-96).</p>
</div>
<p>Only a few of the general public could distinguish between a
heavier-than-air powered flying machine and a lighter-than-air gas
bag equipped with propellers. Few knew that the problem of powered
flight was not to fill a balloon with gas or hot air and float
in it, or to glide in a complicated kite against air currents. Many
among those who realized the obstacles to heavier-than-air flight in
a powered machine believed it was as impossible as perpetual motion.</p>
<p>Wilbur and Orville acknowledged Otto Lilienthal, a famous German
pioneer in aviation, as their greatest inspiration. Recognized
as the father of gliding, Lilienthal made hundreds of glides with
various apparatuses employing birdlike wings. First to explain scientifically
why curved surfaces in a flying machine are superior to flat
surfaces, Lilienthal&rsquo;s work on wing surfaces and air pressure proved
valuable to the Wrights. Interested in scientific affairs, the brothers
read with fascination and excitement, reports in 1895 of gliding flights
by Lilienthal. But the art of gliding was neither a game nor child&rsquo;s
play for aviation&rsquo;s pioneers. Lilienthal crashed and died as a result
of a glider accident in 1896. Reading of his death, the Wrights
wondered if they could go on from where he had left off.</p>

<p>Eventually the Wrights were ready to begin &ldquo;a systematic study
of the subject in preparation for practical work,&rdquo; and hoped to make
contributions &ldquo;to help on the future worker who will attain final
success.&rdquo; Searching for, but finding little material on attempts to
fly in the Dayton Public Library, Wilbur wrote, in May 1899, to
the Smithsonian Institution in Washington seeking information about
publications to read on aeronautics. The list of books and articles
suggested by the Smithsonian included works by Dr. Samuel P.
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
Langley who later became its director and secretary. The brothers
were encouraged by seeing that a man of Langley&rsquo;s scientific standing
believed in the possibility of flight at a time when few people
did. Langley had been making aeronautical studies and experiments
and succeeded in building power-driven models that flew. Later he
built and attempted to fly a full-size, man-carrying powered machine;
but in this he failed.</p>
<p>When a model flies, it does not necessarily follow that a full-size
machine of the same design will also fly. As boys Wilbur and Orville
had built model P&eacute;naud helicopters that flew, but even the
Wrights could not later have built a successful man-carrying machine
by merely following P&eacute;naud&rsquo;s same general design. The difficulty
is&mdash;as early experimenters with model machines unhappily discovered&mdash;that
when the linear measurement of a model is doubled
it needs about eight times the power to make it fly.</p>
<p>Among the sources suggested by the Smithsonian was Octave
Chanute&rsquo;s <i>Progress in Flying Machines</i>. Chanute, a successful construction
engineer living in Chicago, had directed experiments with
gliders of his own design. A longtime encouraging friend and adviser
to the Wrights, Chanute made an exhaustive study of the history
of aeronautics.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><i>Problems of Flight</i></span></h2>
<p>A pioneer experimenter once said that &ldquo;it is easy to invent a flying
machine; it is more difficult to build one&mdash;but to make one fly is
everything.&rdquo; As Lilienthal had seen, the Wrights also saw that, if
ever they were to make progress in solving the problems of flight,
they had not only to study them theoretically, but also to get up
into the air in gliders and test their theories by actual practice. &ldquo;If
you are looking for perfect safety,&rdquo; said Wilbur, &ldquo;you will do well
to sit on a fence and watch the birds; but if you really wish to learn,
you must mount a machine and become acquainted with its tricks
by actual trial.&rdquo; Preferring the air to a fence, the brothers recognized
that when undertaking to fly gliders their first major problem
would be how to fly safely so they could live long enough to learn
to fly a powered machine.</p>
<p>Wilbur wrote his father:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not intend to take dangerous chances, both because I have no
wish to get hurt and because a fall would stop my experimenting, which
I would not like at all. The man who wishes to keep at the problem
long enough to really learn anything positively must not take
dangerous risks. Carelessness and overconfidence are usually more dangerous
than deliberately accepted risks.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>The problem of equilibrium was the second major problem that
the brothers had to solve. They needed to devise measures to steer
or control a flying machine both up and down and to each side.</p>
<p>When the Wrights started their investigations they believed that
others had already solved the problems of how to design wings,
propellers, and motors. Only later did they realize that they must
also correctly design both the wings and the propellers and build
their own motor. Thus their third major problem became how to
design wings sufficiently strong to support the weight of the machine,
motor, and pilot to take the greatest advantage of air particles
providing lift by streaming along the upper and lower surfaces
of the wings.</p>
<p>A fourth major problem that faced Wilbur and Orville was how
to design a light-weight, high-powered engine and the propellers
required to drive the machine through the air. They were to find
that these problems were interrelated and that they would solve them
only after 4&frac12; years of spare-time study and experimentation.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small"><i>First Experiments, 1899</i></span></h2>
<p>Wilbur and Orville realized that the motion of the air on a flying
machine is frequently variable and tricky, causing the machine to
rear up or down, or one wing to rise higher than the other, and
the machine to become unstable. The problem&mdash;how to control
a flying machine&mdash;was to find a method of restoring the machine&rsquo;s
equilibrium both up and down and to each side.</p>
<p>Most pre-Wright experimenters had relied on human control to
balance flying machines. The operator simply shifted the weight of
his body to tilt the wings in the direction opposite from adverse
action of the wind. But the continual contortions and acrobatics
required to maintain equilibrium by this method were not within the
skill of many experimenters. While using it, both Lilienthal and
Percy S. Pilcher, an English experimenter, were killed in nose dives.</p>
<p>Chanute sought to effect &ldquo;automatic stability&rdquo; independent of the
operator by causing the flying machine&rsquo;s structurally automatic supporting
surfaces to adjust positions by flexible joints automatically
with changes in the wind. Wilbur and Orville were to conceive a
different method of control than that sought by Chanute, though
they themselves later designed and patented an &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; device&mdash;a
pendulum analogous to Sperry&rsquo;s gyroscope.</p>

<p>At Dayton, in 1899, the Wrights were ready to move beyond the
first phase of study, speculation, and discussion. Their combined
attack on the problem of equilibrium resulted in the conception of
one of the fundamental principles of aeronautics. Their reasoned
principle for lateral control of a flying machine was that the movement
of an airfoil about its longitudinal axis could be controlled by
means of a pressure differential exerted on its opposing lateral extremities
(the principle known today as aileron control). Both
modern-day ailerons and the Wrights&rsquo; wing-warping are merely arbitrary
mechanical devices for applying this principle. The brothers&rsquo;
first achievement was the conception of the principle itself.</p>
<p>Wilbur and Orville decided first to test their principle of control
in a small model glider to see if it worked, thus sparing themselves
from being injured if it did not. At first it occurred to them to
effect the result of their principle by pivoting the right and left wings
on geared shafts at the stable center of a glider. One wing would
turn upward in front when the other turned down, and the balance
would readjust. But there seemed to be no way to make this device
strong enough without making the glider too heavy. They
finally decided on warping or twisting the wings as the simplest
and most effective method to effect the result of their principle. (It
still would be effective if used today.) The wingtips were to be
warped by means of cables controlled by the operator. By warping
the wingtips, they expected to vary the inclination of sections of
the wings at the tips, and obtain force for restoring balance from
the difference in the lifts of the two wingtips.</p>
<p>While twisting a small pasteboard box with opposite ends removed,
Wilbur observed that though the vertical sides were rigid endwise,
the top and bottom sides could be twisted to have different angles
at the opposite ends. Here was a simple means of warping the wings
as they intended. They decided that a biplane&rsquo;s wings could be
twisted or warped in like manner, enabling them while flying in a
glider to warp the wings on the right and left sides to present their
surfaces to the air at different angles. By warping the wingtips the
operator would be able to increase the angle of attack on one
wingtip and decrease it on the other. Thus, they believed, the
operator could obtain a greater lift on whichever side he needed
it and less lift on the other side in order to assure lateral equilibrium.
(They later had to modify this by adding a movable vertical
tail.)</p>
<p>To test their principle safely, the brothers built a model glider&mdash;actually
a kite&mdash;with a 5-foot wingspan. Flown as a kite at Dayton,
the model glider&rsquo;s wing surfaces were warped by the use of
four cords reaching from the upper and lower wingtips on each side
to the operator on the ground. Balance from front to rear was maintained
in part by an elevator tested variously at the front and rear,
as well as by other means. The Wrights believed after the tests
that the model glider had demonstrated the efficiency of their system
of obtaining both lateral and longitudinal control.</p>

<p class="pcap">The brothers decided to test their glider at Kitty Hawk after a study of Weather
Bureau records and the receipt of this letter.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small"><i>Why Kitty Hawk?</i></span></h2>
<p>Wilbur and Orville now proposed to build a full-size, man-carrying
glider on which to test their method of control. Highly enthusiastic
with the idea of gliding as a sport, they started thinking of a
place for testing it. To get practice in operating the glider, they
would first fly it as a kite before making gliding flights. For kite
flying, steady winds and flat, open country were needed; for the
gliding, a sandy area for soft landings and sandhill slopes free of
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
trees and shrubs for low-level flights. The Wrights&rsquo; hometown of
Dayton and its environs were not suitable for extensive glider trials.
But because of their business demands, they wanted a site fairly
close at hand.</p>
<p>On May 13, 1900, Wilbur wrote his first letter to Chanute asking
advice on a suitable location to test a glider. In this letter to the
man who became their friend, mentor, and most important correspondent,
Wilbur stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For some years I have been afflicted with the belief that flight is possible
to man. My disease has increased in severity and I feel that it
will soon cost me an increased amount of money if not my life....
It is possible to fly without motors, but not without knowledge &amp; skill.
This I conceive to be fortunate, for man, by reason of his greater intellect,
can more reasonably hope to equal birds in knowledge, than
to equal nature in the perfection of her machinery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chanute suggested beach locations for glider tests in California,
Florida, Georgia, or South Carolina. But after a study of wind records
obtained from the Weather Bureau at Washington, the Wrights
decided that Kitty Hawk, N.C., seemed to meet their requirements
better than any other place within that distance from their home.
To confirm this, they wrote to Kitty Hawk, and the replies from
Joseph J. Dosher and William J. Tate convinced the brothers that
Kitty Hawk was the ideal place for their experiments. They decided
to go there as soon as they could build their glider and their
bicycle business permitted.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small"><i>Glider Experiments, 1900</i></span></h2>
<p>At Dayton, the Wrights began to assemble parts and materials for
a full-size, man-carrying glider to test their method of warping the
wings to achieve lateral control, and a forward rudder for fore-and-aft
balance. In September 1900 Wilbur undertook the journey to
Kitty Hawk. Orville followed him later. At the turn of the century
such a trip to the isolated village required time and patience.
It lies on the Outer Banks of North Carolina between broad Albemarle
Sound and the Atlantic Ocean. Then no bridges connected
it with the mainland so travel across the sound was by boat.</p>
<p>Wilbur traveled by train from Dayton to Elizabeth City, N.C., the
nearest railroad point to his destination. Asking the first persons
he chanced to meet about Kitty Hawk he learned that &ldquo;no one
seemed to know anything about the place or how to get there.&rdquo;
Those better informed had vexing information: the boat making
weekly trips to the Outer Banks had gone the day before. For several
days he patiently waited to be dubiously rewarded by passage
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
with Israel Perry on a flat-bottom fishing schooner, then anchored
3 miles down the Pasquotank River from the wharf at Elizabeth
City.</p>

<p>The small skiff used to take Wilbur from the wharf out to the
anchored schooner was loaded almost to the gunwale with three men
and supplies. Noticing that the skiff leaked badly, Wilbur asked if
it was safe. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Perry assured him, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s safer than the big boat.&rdquo;
Even so, the schooner managed to sail down the Pasquotank River
and through Albemarle Sound safely enough in the rough weather.</p>
<p>It was 9 o&rsquo;clock the following night before the schooner reached
the wharf at Kitty Hawk. Though hungry and aching from the
strain of holding on while the schooner rolled and pitched, Wilbur
did not go ashore until the next morning.</p>

<p>Later, Orville joined Wilbur at Kitty Hawk where both brothers
boarded and lodged with the family of William J. Tate until October
4, when they set up their own camp about half a mile away
from the village. Native Outer Bankers showed only mild interest
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
in the Wrights&rsquo; hopes of flying, but they became excited when they
learned that the brothers were keeping in their tent, as fuel for a
newfangled gasoline cookstove, the first barrel of gasoline ever
taken to the Kitty Hawk area. Fearing an explosion, local folk
warily warned their children to keep well away from the brothers&rsquo;
tent. Orville was the cook while in camp; to Wilbur fell the dishwashing
chore. Orville always felt that he had the better of the
bargain.</p>

<p class="pcap">The 1900 glider flying as a kite.</p>
</div>
<p>The new glider was a double-decker with a span of about 17 feet,
and a total lifting area of 165 square feet. Its weight with operator
was 190 pounds. It cost $15 to make. The uprights were jointed
to the top and bottom wings with flexible hinges, and the glider
was trussed with steel wires laterally, but not in the fore-and-aft
direction. The operator, lying prone on the lower wing to lessen
head resistance, maintained lateral equilibrium by tightening a key
wire which, in turn, tightened every other wire, applying twist to
the wingtips. The glider had no tail. Its wing curvature was less
than Lilienthal had used.</p>
<p>Wilbur and Orville placed the horizontal operative rudder or elevator
in front to provide longitudinal stability. They believed that
by placing it in front they would have more up-and-down control
to forestall nose dives similar to those that had killed Lilienthal and
Pilcher. The Wrights did not invent the elevator. They did use it
to more advantage than had earlier experimenters: it was in front
of the wings; it was operative instead of fixed; and it flexed to present
a convex surface to the air, instead of a flat surface.</p>
<p>The Wrights first flew the glider in the open as a kite. They
held it with two ropes and operated the balancing system by cords
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
from the ground. The first day&rsquo;s experiments were attempted with
a man on board, using a derrick erected on a hill just south of their
camp. The glider was not flown from the derrick again at Kitty
Hawk after the first day&rsquo;s tests. On days when the wind was too
light to support a man on the glider, they used chain for ballast
or flew the machine as a kite in the open without ballast.</p>

<p class="pcap">The brothers spent 3 days repairing the 1900 glider, wrecked by wind on
Oct. 10, 1900.</p>
</div>
<p>Before returning to Dayton, the brothers were determined to try
gliding on the side of a hill with a man on board. Four miles
south of their camp was a magnificent sand dune about 100 feet
high, covering 26 acres, called Kill Devil Hill. They carried their
glider to this hill where they made about a dozen free flights down
its side.</p>
<p>To take-off from the hillside, one brother and an assistant holding
the ends of the glider ran forward against the wind, while the
brother who was to operate it ran with them until the machine began
to &ldquo;take hold&rdquo; of the air, or was airborne. Then the operator
jumped aboard and glided free down the hill for 300 or 400 feet,
usually gliding only 3 or 4 feet above the soft, sandy ground. The
Wrights repeatedly made landings on sledlike skids while moving
at a speed of more than 20 miles an hour. The glider was not damaged,
nor did the brothers receive any injury. &ldquo;The machine
seemed a rather docile thing,&rdquo; Orville wrote to his sister, from
Kitty Hawk, &ldquo;and we taught it to behave fairly well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Wilbur and Orville had misread the weather charts they had studied
when choosing Kitty Hawk as the location for their experiments.
The charts had listed monthly averages, while the day-by-day weather
proved to be less than ideal. On some days tests could not be made
because of a dead calm; other days the wind blew too strong&mdash;up
to 45 miles an hour. Orville wrote about the strong winds that
blew:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A little excitement once in a while is not undesirable, but every night,
especially when you are so sleepy, it becomes a little monotonous....
About two or three nights a week we have to crawl up at ten or eleven
o&rsquo;clock to hold the tent down.... We certainly can&rsquo;t complain of
the place. We came down here for wind and sand, and we have got
them.</p>

</div>
<p>Even though the Wrights had only brief spells of favorable weather
for practice, they learned much from their experiments. They were
pleased with the efficiency of wing-warping to obtain lateral balance,
and the horizontal rudder for fore-and-aft control worked better than
they had expected. Though Wilbur and Orville believed that fore-and-aft
balance and lateral balance were equally important, they were
gratified that fore-and-aft balance was so easily attained. They made
careful measurements of lift, drag, and angle of attack. The main
defect of the glider was its inadequate lifting power. This might
be due, the brothers conjectured, to insufficient curvature or camber
of the wings which did not have the curvature used by Lilienthal,
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
or perhaps even the Lilienthal tables of air pressure might be in
error.</p>
<p>Although important strides had been made toward solving the
problem of control, Wilbur and Orville lacked opportunity for sufficient
practice since they did not get much time in the air. There
still remained much for them to learn before solving the major
problems of how to (1) design wings properly, (2) control the aircraft
in flight, and (3) provide power, in order to build and fly a
powered machine. They knew that they must learn how properly
to build and control a glider before attempting to add a motor.
&ldquo;When once a machine is under proper control under all conditions,&rdquo;
Wilbur wrote his father from camp, &ldquo;the motor problem will be
quickly solved. A failure of motor will then mean simply a slow
descent &amp; safe landing instead of a disastrous fall.&rdquo; They looked
forward to the next slack season in the bicycle business so that they
might resume experiments with a new glider.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small"><i>Glider Experiments, 1901</i></span></h2>
<p>In July 1901 the Wrights returned to Kitty Hawk during a downpour
of rain immediately after a storm had broken anemometer cups
at 93 miles an hour. There followed a miserable week spent fighting
mosquitoes, &ldquo;which came in a mighty cloud, almost darkening
the sun.&rdquo; They attempted to escape by going to bed early, wrapped
up in blankets with only noses protruding cautiously from the folds.
But the July heat became unbearable beneath the blankets. When
they partly uncovered, the mosquitoes again swooped down upon
them, forcing a perspiring retreat once more behind blankets. But
Wilbur and Orville pushed forward good-humoredly and energetically
to solve the problem of flight.</p>
<p>During the 1900-1902 experiments, the Wright family, and the
brothers themselves, considered the brother&rsquo;s stay in camp at Kitty
Hawk simply as pleasure trips or vacations. Everyone in the family
was glad to have them go to their North Carolina camp. The
advantages of the sunshine, sea breezes, and outdoor exercise outweighed
occasional discomforts and seemed to be good for their
health. Indeed, their sister Katharine wrote, &ldquo;Will and Orv ...
think that life at Kitty Hawk cures all ills, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being sons of a bishop who enjoined them &ldquo;to honor the Sabbath,&rdquo;
the brothers did not test their gliders on Sundays while in
camp. On those days they often visited with the friendly and hospitable
people in Kitty Hawk, and at nearby lifesaving stations. They
frequently wrote home. One of Orville&rsquo;s hobbies&mdash;photography&mdash;also
resulted in a fine record of the early experiments. They collected
shells and went hunting and fishing. Orville observed while
in camp, &ldquo;This is great country for fishing and hunting. The fish
are so thick you see dozens of them whenever you look down into
the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For living quarters the Wrights continued using a tent. To provide
more space they erected a combined glider storage shed and
workshop, the building of which they undertook on arrival at camp
in 1901. Fresh water was secured nearby by driving a pipe 10 feet
or more into the sand.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig24">
<img src="images/p13b.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="552" />
<p class="pcap">The Landing</p>
</div>
<p>Their new campsite was located 4 miles south of Kitty Hawk,
about 1,000 feet north of Kill Devil Hill, which they had used for
gliding the season before and which they now realized offered the
best test opportunities. Near the camp were four dunes formed of
sand heaped by the winds. These dunes were collectively named
Kill Devil Hills. They were constantly changing in height and
slope, according to the direction and force of the prevailing winds.
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
Using three of the four Kill Devil Hills for gliding experiments
during the period 1900-1903, the Wrights called these the Big Kill
Devil Hill, the West Hill, and the Little Hill.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig25">
<img src="images/p14.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="415" />
<p class="pcap">The second glider was stored in the wooden shed while the tent served as living
quarters at Kill Devil Hills in 1901. Here Wilbur and Orville spent many hours
discussing their experiments.</p>
</div>
<p>On the 1901 trip to camp the brothers brought with them parts
to be assembled into a larger glider than the one tested in 1900.
Knowing it would be impractical to house the larger glider with
them in the tent, as they had done with the smaller one, they built
a rough frame shed for the new glider and for use as a workshop.
This building was 25 feet long and 16 feet wide. Its ends
were hinged at the top near the gable parts to form doors so the
glider could be removed or stored easily. The doors also served as
awnings at the ends of the building.</p>
<p>When assembled, the new glider had a wingspan of 22 feet. It
weighed 98 pounds, nearly double the weight of the earlier glider.
To give it greater lifting power, the glider had a total lifting area
of 290 square feet, considerably larger than the 165-foot wing area
of the previous glider. The 1901 glider was a much larger machine
than anyone had ever dared try to fly. It had the same system of
control and general design as the first one. The Wrights increased
the camber in this glider, from 1 in 22 to 1 in 12 to conform to
the shape prescribed by Lilienthal&rsquo;s tables of air pressure. Chanute
and others had used these tables, and the brothers were rudely surprised
upon finding that wings with a camber of 1 in 12 were even
less efficient than the 1-in-22 camber wings they had used in 1900.</p>
<p>The Wrights were also dismayed to discover that the fore-and-aft
control was not as effective in a machine with wings of 1-in-12
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
camber. At times when gliding, they were required to use all their
skill and the full power of the rudder to prevent the glider from
rearing up so sharply as to lose all headway and then to plunge
toward the ground (a dangerous condition which they later referred
to as &ldquo;stalling&rdquo;&mdash;an aeronautical term still in use). The brothers
reduced the camber of the wings by adding little &ldquo;trussing posts&rdquo;
to wires to depress the ribs and flatten the curvature from that used
by others to 1 in 18 to make the wings more like those of their
1900 glider. This change resulted in control as good as it had been
the year before.</p>
<p>Several hundred glides were made by Wilbur and Orville during
the 1901 season of experiments. Using the slopes of Kill Devil
Hill and West Hill, they sailed along in winds up to 27 miles an
hour, breaking all records for distance in gliding. But the brothers
were far from satisfied. They had learned a great deal about control,
though their glider was still too feeble in lifting itself off the
ground and staying aloft.</p>
<p>Occasionally in free flight, the warping of the wings to increase
the angle of attack to recover lateral balance did not produce the
desired result. The wing having the greater angle sometimes lost
speed as it lifted, compared with the opposite wing having a lesser
angle. The brothers then realized that the greater angle of the wing
on one side gave more resistance to forward motion and reduced
the relative speed of that wing. This decrease in speed more than
counterbalanced the effect of the larger angle of the wing in producing
lift. The Wrights determined that they must add something
to their method of controlling equilibrium to insure that
equal speeds at the wingtips would be maintained. However, a
vertical tail as a solution to the problem was left for the next glider.</p>
<p>Contrary to the scientific texts they had read, it was becoming
evident to the Wrights that the travel of the center of pressure on
curved or cambered surfaces was not always in the forward direction
as on a plane surface. They observed that when the angle of attack
on a plane surface was decreased, the center of pressure did move
toward the front edge; but on a cambered surface this was true <i>only
when large angles were being decreased</i>.</p>
<p>Wilbur and Orville were discouraged that the ideas about pressures
on curved surfaces and travel of center of pressure, concepts
advanced by the most reputable writers on the subject, including
Langley, were unreliable. So perplexing did the problem seem that
the Wrights considered dropping their experiments altogether. It
was apparent, then, that better scientific data were needed before
the problems of flight could be solved.</p>
<p>On their way to Dayton from camp, Wilbur declared his belief
to Orville that not within a thousand years would man ever fly!
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
He later reduced this prophecy to 50 years. When they made known
their discouragement to Chanute he urged the brothers to continue
their researches, arguing that if they stopped experimenting it might
be a long time before anyone else would come as near to understanding
the problem or know how to work toward its solution.
The admonitions of Chanute and their own intense interest in scientific
inquiry led them to continue their research.</p>

<h2 id="c9"><span class="small"><i>Wind-Tunnel Tests, 1901</i></span></h2>
<p>Shortly after their return to Dayton, the Wrights undertook a series
of scientific experiments which produced knowledge that no one had
possessed before and that contributed materially to their solution of
the problem of powered flight. Disappointed by the relatively poor
results achieved at Kitty Hawk with their 1901 glider, in the construction
of which they had relied on Lilienthal&rsquo;s and other published
tables of air pressures, the Wrights decided to start again
from scratch by conducting laboratory tests of their own and by
evolving their own air pressure tables from measurements made with
model airfoils (miniature wing surfaces) using a simple but effective
homemade wind tunnel.</p>
<p>Their second wind tunnel&mdash;the first was a makeshift affair hurriedly
contrived by Orville out of a wooden starch box and was used for just
a few days and then only in preliminary tests&mdash;consisted of an open-end
wooden box 6 feet long and 16 inches square (inside dimensions).
Through this box-like tunnel a flat-bladed fan forced a current
of air at a speed of about 25 miles an hour. The air entered
the tunnel through a funnel-shaped metal section equipped with a
honeycomb-type wind straightener to produce a uniform airflow.
The most ingenious parts of the Wright wind tunnel were the two
balances they designed for measuring the lift and drag of the model
air-foils. Using these balances, the forces could be read as angles
from a pointer moving over a protractor fixed to the floor of the
tunnel.</p>
<p>In a period of about 2 months toward the close of 1901, the
Wrights tested more than 200 surfaces. They measured monoplane,
biplane, and triplane wing models. Among these shapes were
models of the bird-like wing surfaces used by Lilienthal and the
tandem arrangement (in which one wing followed the other) used
by Langley. They measured lift and drag forces at various angles
from 2&deg; to 45&deg;, tangentials, gliding angles, and lift/drag ratios;
they tested the effect of aspect ratio and the effect on lift of varying
the camber of curvature of the surfaces, and tried a variety of
shapes and thicknesses for the leading and trailing edges, for wingtips,
and for such structural members as uprights.</p>
<p>As a result of these experiments, all carefully carried out and
minutely recorded, they obtained a body of data on air pressures and
on the aerodynamic properties of wings, control surfaces, and structural
parts. The extent and reliability of the information from these
tests far exceeded anything that had ever been available to other experimenters
or was to be available for at least another decade. Their
friend and correspondent, Octave Chanute, marveled at the speed
and accuracy with which this laboratory research was carried out.
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
The Wrights themselves soon came to realize that these scientific
experiments, on which they had embarked with considerable reluctance,
were in fact the most valuable part of all their work in that
they gave them accounts and detailed knowledge on which to base
the design of flying machines.</p>

</div>
<p>The wind-tunnel experiments concluded in December 1901 made
it possible for the Wrights to abandon the trial-and-error method of
construction that had gone into their 1900 and 1901 gliders and to
solve the basic problem of the correct design for lifting wings.
Now they were able to devote their time to the two other major
problems that had to be solved before human flight could be accomplished:
a system for obtaining full control in the air, and the
addition of an engine and propellers to the aircraft.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small"><i>Glider Experiments, 1902</i></span></h2>
<p>The Wrights had faith in the tables of air pressure compiled from
their wind-tunnel experiments. Their new knowledge was incorporated
into a larger glider which they built based on the aerodynamic
data they had gained. Now they wanted to verify those findings
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
by actual gliding experiments. At the end of August 1902, they were
back in camp at Kill Devil Hills for the third season of experiments.
Battered by winter gales, their camp needed repairing. They decided
to build a 15-foot addition to the combined workshop and glider-storage
shed to use as a kitchen and living quarters. Their new living
quarters were &ldquo;royal luxuries&rdquo; when compared with the tent facilities
of previous camps.</p>
<p>The new glider had a wingspan of 32 feet, 1 inch; a considerable
increase over the wingspan of 22 feet for the 1901 glider. Its lifting
area, 305 square feet, was not much greater than the glider of
the previous year. Their wind-tunnel experiments having demonstrated
the importance of aspect ratio, the brothers made the wingspan
about six times the chord or fore-and-aft measurement instead
of three. Weighing 112 pounds, the glider was 16 feet, 1 inch
long. In the 1900 and 1901 gliders, the wing-warping mechanism
had been worked by movement of the operator&rsquo;s feet. In the 1902
glider this mechanism operated by sidewise movement of the operator&rsquo;s
hips resting in a cradle on the lower wing. Wilbur wrote
his father from camp, &ldquo;Our new machine is a very great improvement
over anything we had built before and over anything any one
has built.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap">One of the successful glides made in October 1902 with the 1902 glider, camp
buildings in distance.</p>
</div>
<p>This was the first Wright glider to have a tail, consisting of fixed
twin vertical vanes, as well as a front rudder. The tail&rsquo;s purpose
was to overcome the turning difficulties encountered in some of the
flights with the 1901 glider by maintaining equal speeds at the two
wingtips when the wings were warped. The tail was expected to
counterbalance the difference in resistance of the two wingtips. If
the wing on one side tended to swerve forward, then the Wrights
thought the tail, being more exposed to the wind on the same side,
should stop the glider from turning farther.</p>
<p>The tail on this glider, however, caused a new problem that had
not occurred in their previous gliders. At times, when struck by a
side gust of wind, the glider turned up sidewise and came sliding
laterally to the ground in spite of the effort and skill of the operator
in using the warping mechanism to control it. The brothers
were experiencing tailspins, though that term did not come into use
until several years later. When tailspins occurred, the glider would
sometimes slide so fast that the movement caused the tail&rsquo;s fixed
vertical vanes to aggravate the turning movement instead of counteracting
it by maintaining an equal speed at the opposite wingtips.
The result was worse than if there were no fixed vertical tail.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>While lying awake one night, Orville thought of converting their
vertical tail from two fixed vanes to a single movable rudder. When
making a turn or recovering lateral balance, this rudder could be
moved toward the low wing to compensate for the increased drag
imparted to the high wing by its greater angle of attack. Wilbur
listened attentively when Orville told him about the idea the next
morning. Then, without hesitation, Wilbur not only agreed to the
change but immediately proposed the further important modification
of interconnecting the rudder control wires with those of the
wing-warping. Thus by a single movement the operator could affect
both controls. Through the brilliant interplay of two inventive
minds, all the essentials of the Wright control system were completed
within a few hours.</p>
<p>The combination of warp and rudder control became the key to
successful control of their powered machine and to the control of
all aircraft since. (Modern airplanes&mdash;and indeed Wright planes
after the middle of their 1905 experimental season&mdash;do not have the
aileron and rudder controls permanently interconnected, but these
controls can be and are operated in combination when necessary.)
Together with the use of the forward elevator, it allowed the Wrights
to perform all the basic aerial maneuvers that were necessary for controlled
flight. The essential problem of how to control a flying
machine about all three axes was now solved.</p>
<p>The trials of the 1902 glider were successful beyond expectation.
Nearly 1,000 glider flights were made by the Wrights from Kill Devil,
West, and Little Hills. A number of their glides were of more than
600 feet, and a few of them were against a 36-mile-an-hour wind.
Flying in winds so strong required great skill on the part of the
operator. No previous experimenter had ever dared to try gliding
in so stiff a wind. Orville wrote his sister, &ldquo;We now hold all the records!
The largest machine we handled in any kind [of weather, made
the longest dis]tance glide (American), the longest time in the air,
the smallest angle of descent, and the highest wind!!!&rdquo; Their record
glide for distance was 622&frac12; feet in 26 seconds. Their record
glide for angle was an angle of 5&deg; for a glide of 156 feet. The 1902
glider had about twice the dynamic efficiency of any other glider ever
built up to that time anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>By the end of the 1902 season of experiments, the Wrights had
solved two of the major problems: how properly to design wings
and control surfaces and how to control a flying machine about
its three axes. Most of the battle was now won. There remained
only the major problem of adding the engine and propellers. Before
leaving camp, the brothers began designing a new and still larger
machine to be powered with a motor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>It was the 1902 glider that the Wrights pictured and described
in the drawings and specifications of their patent, which they applied
for in March of the following year. Their patent was established,
through the action of the courts in the United States and abroad,
as the basic or pioneer airplane patent.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small"><i>The Motor and the Propellers</i></span></h2>
<p>Home again in Dayton, the Wrights were ready to carry out plans
begun in camp at Kill Devil Hills for a powered machine. They
invited bids for a gasoline engine which would develop 8 to 9 horsepower,
weigh no more than 180 pounds or an average of 20 pounds
per horsepower, and be free of vibrations. None of the manufacturers
to whom they wrote was able to supply them with a motor
light enough to meet these specifications. The Wrights therefore
designed and built their own motor, with their mechanic, Charles
E. Taylor, giving them enthusiastic help in the construction.</p>

<p>The engine body and frame of the first &ldquo;little gas motor&rdquo; which
they began building in December 1902 broke while being tested.
Rebuilding the light-weight motor, they shop-tested it in May 1903.
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
In its final form the motor used in the first powered flights had 4
horizontal cylinders of 4-inch bore and 4-inch stroke, with an aluminum-alloy
crankcase and water jacket. The fuel tank had a
capacity of four-tenths of a gallon of gasoline. The entire power
plant including the engine, magneto, radiator, tank, water, fuel,
tubing, and accessories weighed a little more than 200 pounds.</p>

<p class="pcap">Propeller estimates, made by the Wrights 8 months before the flights of December
1903. Their formulas resulted in the highly efficient propellers which were
used in the first Wright Flyer. These were 8&frac12; feet from one canvas-covered tip
to the other. Top view shows the front, bottom view, the rear.</p>
</div>
<p>Owing to certain peculiarities of design, after several minutes&rsquo; run
the engine speed dropped to less than 75 percent of what it was
on cranking the motor. The highest engine speed measured developed
15.76 horsepower at 1,200 revolutions per minute in the first
15 seconds after starting the cold motor. After several minutes&rsquo; run
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
the number of revolutions dropped rapidly to 1,090 per minute, developing
11.81 brake horsepower. Even so, the Wrights were
pleasantly surprised since they had not counted on more than 8
horsepower capable of driving a machine weighing only about 625
pounds. Having a motor with a power output of about 12 horsepower
instead of 8, the Wrights could build the machine to have a
larger total weight than 625 pounds.</p>
<p>The motor was started with the aid of a dry-battery coil box.
After starting, ignition was provided by a low-tension magneto,
friction-driven by the flywheel. No pump was used in the cooling
system. The vertical sheet-steel radiator was attached to the central
forward upright of the machine.</p>
<p>When the brothers began to consider designing propellers, they
unhappily discovered that the forces in action on aerial propellers
had never been correctly resolved or defined. Since they did not have
sufficient time or funds to develop an efficient propeller by the more
costly trial-and-error means, it was necessary for them to study the
screw propeller from a theoretical standpoint. By studying the problem,
they hoped to develop a theory from which to design the propellers
for the powered machine. The problem was not easy, as the
Wrights wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What at first seemed a simple problem became more complex the
longer we studied it. With the machine moving forward, the air flying
backward, the propellers turning sidewise, and nothing standing
still, it seemed impossible to find a starting point from which to trace
the various simultaneous reactions. Contemplation of it was confusing.
After long arguments we often found ourselves in the ludicrous position
of each having been converted to the other&rsquo;s side, with no more
agreement than when the discussion began.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, in a few months the brothers untangled the conflicting
factors and calculations. After studying the problem, they felt sure
of their ability to design propellers of exactly the right diameter,
pitch, and area for their need. Estimates derived from their formulas
led to their propellers operating at a higher rate of efficiency (66
percent) than any others of that day. The tremendous expenditure
of power that characterized experiments of other aeronautical investigators
up to that time were due to inefficient propellers as well as
inefficient lifting surfaces.</p>
<p>The Wright propellers, designed according to their own calculations,
were the first propellers ever built by anyone for which the
performance could be predicted. After tests, their propellers produced
not quite 1 percent less thrust than they had calculated. In
useful work they gave about two thirds of the power expended&mdash;a
third more than had been achieved by such men as Sir Hiram Maxim
and Dr. Langley.</p>

</div>
<p>The brothers decided to use two propellers on their powered machine
for two reasons. First, by using two propellers they could
secure a reaction against a greater quantity of air and use a larger
pitch angle than was possible with one propeller; and second, having
the two propellers run in opposite directions, the gyroscopic
action of one would neutralize that of the other. The two pusher-type
propellers on the 1903 powered machine were mounted on
tubular shafts about 10 feet apart, both driven by chains running
over sprockets. By crossing one of the chains in a figure eight, the
propellers were run in opposite directions to counteract torque.
The propellers were made of three laminations of spruce, each 1&#8539;
inches thick. The wood was glued together and shaped with a
hatchet and drawshave.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small"><i>The Powered Machine, 1903</i></span></h2>
<p>The 1903 machine had a wingspan of 40 feet, 4 inches, a camber
of 1 in 20; a wing area of 510 square feet; and a length of 21 feet,
1 inch. It weighed 605 pounds without a pilot. The machine was
not symmetrical from side to side; the engine was placed on the
lower wing to the right of center to reduce the danger of its falling
on the pilot. The pilot would ride lying prone as on the gliders
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
but to the left of center to balance the weight. The right wing
was approximately 4 inches longer than the left to provide additional
lift to compensate for the engine which weighed 34 pounds
more than the pilot.</p>
<p>Fore-and-aft control was by means of the elevator in front, operated
by hand lever. The tail of the machine had twin movable
rudders instead of a single movable rudder developed in the 1902
glider. These rudders were linked by wires to the wing-warping
system. Their coordinated control mechanism was worked by wires
attached to a cradle on the lower wing, in which the pilot lay prone.
To turn the machine to the left, the pilot moved his body, and with
it the cradle, a few inches to the left. This caused the rear right
wingtips to be pulled down or warped (thus giving more lift and
raising them) and the rear left wingtips to move upward, and at the
same time the coordinating mechanism introduced enough left rudder
to compensate for yaw. The rudder counteracted the added resistance
of the wing with the greater angle and the resulting tendency
of the machine to swing in the opposite direction to the desired left
turn, as well as aiding the turn on its own account.</p>

<p>On September 25, 1903, the Wrights arrived once more at their
Kill Devil Hills camp. They repaired and again used the living
quarters which they had added to the storage building in 1902,
called their &ldquo;summer house.&rdquo; Their 1902 glider, which they had left
stored in this building after that season of experiments, was again
housed with them in the building. They erected a new building to
house the powered machine alongside the glider-storage and living-quarters
building and commenced the chore of assembling the
powered machine in its new hangar. Occasionally they took the
1902 glider out for practice. After a few trials each brother was able
to make a new world&rsquo;s record by gliding for more than a minute.</p>
<p>The first weeks in camp were a time of vicissitudes for the
Wrights. Assembling the machine and installing the engine and
propellers proved an arduous task. When tested, the motor missed
so often that the vibrations twisted one of the propeller shafts and
jerked the assembly apart. Both shafts had to be sent back to their
Dayton bicycle shop to be made stronger. After they had been returned,
one broke again, and Orville had to carry the shafts back to
Dayton to make new ones of more durable material. The magneto
failed to produce a strong enough spark. A stubborn problem was
fastening the sprockets to the propeller shafts; the sprockets and the
nuts loosened within a few seconds even when they were tightened
with a 6-foot lever.</p>
<p>It was then that the weather acted as if it were threatening the
brothers not to venture into a new element. A gale swept over their
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
camp with winds up to 75 miles an hour. As their living quarters
rocked with the wind, and rainwater flowed over part of the floor,
the Wrights expected to hear the new hangar building next door,
which housed the powered machine, crash over completely. &ldquo;The
wind and rain continued through the night,&rdquo; related Wilbur to his sister,
&ldquo;but we took the advice of the Oberlin coach, &lsquo;Cheer up, boys,
there is no hope/&rsquo; We went to bed, and both slept soundly.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>It became so cold that the brothers had to make a heater from a
drum used to hold carbide. Wilbur assured his father:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However we are entirely comfortable, and have no trouble keeping warm
at nights. In addition to the classifications of last year, to wit, 1, 2,
3, and 4 blanket nights, we now have 5 blanket nights, &amp; 5 blankets
&amp; 2 quilts. Next come 5 blankets, 2 quilts &amp; fire; then 5, 2, fire, &amp;
hot-water jug. This as far as we have got so far.</p>

<p class="pcap">The 1903 machine and camp buildings at Kill Devil Hills, Nov. 24, 1903.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>At last the weather cleared, the engine began to purr, their hand-made
heater functioned better after improvements, and, with the help
of a tire cement they had used in their bicycle shop, they &ldquo;stuck
those sprockets so tight I doubt whether they will ever come loose
again.&rdquo; Chanute visited their camp for a few days and wrote
November 23, &ldquo;I believe the new machine of the Wrights to be
the most promising attempt at flight that has yet been made.&rdquo;
Both brothers sensed that the goal was in sight.</p>
<p>The powered machine&rsquo;s undercarriage (landing gear) consisted of
two runners, or sledlike skids, instead of wheels. These were extended
farther out in front of the wings than were the landing skids
on the gliders to guard against the machine rolling over in landing.
Four feet, eight inches apart, the two runners were ideal for landing as
skids on the soft beach sands. But for take-offs, it was necessary to
build a single-rail starting track 60 feet long on which ran a small
truck which held the machine about 8 inches off the ground. The
easily movable starting rail was constructed of four 15-foot 2 &times; 4&rsquo;s
set on edge, with the upper surface topped by a thin strip of metal.</p>
<p>The truck which supported the skids of the plane during the takeoff
consisted of two parts: a crossbeam plank about 6 feet long laid across
a smaller piece of wood forming the truck&rsquo;s undercarriage which
moved along the track on two rollers made from modified bicycle
hubs. For take-offs, the machine was lifted onto the truck with the
plane&rsquo;s undercarriage skids resting on the two opposite ends of the
crossbeam. A modified bicycle hub was attached to the forward
crosspiece of the plane between its skids to prevent the machine from
nosing over on the launching track. A wire from the truck attached
to the end of the starting track held the plane back while the engine
was warmed up. Then the restraining wire was released by the
pilot. The airplane, riding on the truck, started forward along the
rail. If all went well, the machine was airborne and hence lifted
off the truck before reaching the end of the starting track; while the
truck, remaining on the track, continued on and ran off the rail.</p>
<p>With the new propeller shafts installed, the powered machine was
ready for its first testing on December 12. However, the wind was
too light for the machine to take-off from the level ground near their
camp with a run of only 60 feet permitted by the starting track.
Nor did they have enough time before dark to take the machine to
one of the nearby Kill Devil Hills, where, by placing the track on
a steeply inclined slope, enough speed could be promptly attained
for starting in calm air. The following day was Sunday, which the
brothers spent resting and reading, hoping for suitable weather for
flying the next day so that they could be home by Christmas.</p>
<p>On December 14 it was again too calm to permit a start from
level ground near the camp. The Wrights, therefore, decided to take
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
the machine to the north side of Kill Devil Hill about a quarter
of a mile away to make their first attempt to fly in a power-driven
machine. They had arranged to signal nearby life-savers to inform
them when the first trial was ready to start. A signal was placed
on one of the camp buildings that could be seen by personnel on
duty about a mile away at the Kill Devil Hills Life Saving Station.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig44">
<img src="images/p24.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="331" />
<p class="pcap">The first Wright Flyer rests on the starting track at Kill Devil Hill prior to the trial
of Dec. 14, 1903. The four men from the Kill Devil Hills Life Saving Station helped
move the machine from the campsite to the hill. The two boys ran home on hearing
the engine start.</p>
</div>
<p>The Wrights were soon joined by five lifesavers who helped to
transport the machine from camp to Kill Devil Hill. Setting the
605-pound machine on the truck atop the starting track, they ran
the truck to the end of the track and added the rear section of the
track to the front end. By relaying sections of the track, the machine
rode on the truck to the site chosen for the test, 150 feet up
the side of the hill.</p>
<p>The truck, with the machine thereon, facing downhill, was fastened
with a wire to the end of the starting track, so that it could
not start until released by the pilot. The engine was started to
make sure it was in proper condition. Two small boys, with a dog,
who had come with the lifesavers, &ldquo;made a hurried departure over
the hill for home on hearing the engine start.&rdquo; Each brother was
eager for the chance to make the first trial, so a coin was tossed to
determine which of them it should be; Wilbur won.</p>
<p>Wilbur took his place as pilot while Orville held a wing to steady
the machine during the run on the track. The restraining wire was
released, the machine started forward quickly on the rail, leaving
Orville behind. After a run of 35 or 40 feet, the airplane took
off. Wilbur turned the machine up too suddenly after leaving the
track, before it had gained enough speed. It climbed a few feet,
stalled, and settled to the ground at the foot of the hill after being
in the air just 3&frac12; seconds. This trial was considered unsuccessful
because the machine landed at a point at the base of the hill many
feet lower than that from which it had started on the side of the hill.
Wilbur wrote of his trial:</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>However the real trouble was an error in judgment, in turning up too
suddenly after leaving the track, and as the machine had barely speed
enough for support already, this slowed it down so much that before
I could correct the error, the machine began to come down, though
turned up at a big angle. Toward the end it began to speed up again
but it was too late, and it struck the ground while moving a little to
one side, due to wind and a rather bad start.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In landing, one of the skids and several other parts were broken,
preventing a second attempt that day. Repairs were completed by
noon of the 16th, but the wind was too calm to fly the machine
that afternoon. The brothers, however, were confident of soon
making a successful flight. &ldquo;There is now no question of final success,&rdquo;
Wilbur wrote his father, though Langley had recently made
two attempts to fly and had failed in both. &ldquo;This did not disturb
or hurry us in the least,&rdquo; Orville commented on Langley&rsquo;s attempts.
&ldquo;We knew that he had to have better scientific data than was contained
in his published works to successfully build a man-carrying
flying machine.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small"><i>December 17, 1903: The Day Man First Flew</i></span></h2>
<p>Thursday, December 17 dawned, and was to go down in history as
a day when a great engineering feat was accomplished. It was a
cold day with winds of 22 to 27 miles an hour blowing from the
north. Puddles of water near the camp were covered with ice. The
Wrights waited indoors, hoping the winds would diminish. But
they continued brisk, and at 10 in the morning the brothers decided
to attempt a flight, fully realizing the difficulties and dangers of
flying a relatively untried machine in so high a wind.</p>
<p>In strong winds, hills were not needed to launch the machine,
since the force of the winds would enable the machine to take off
on the short starting track from level ground. Indeed, the winds
were almost too gusty to launch the machine at all that day, but
the brothers estimated that the added dangers while in flight would
be compensated in part by the slower speed in landing caused by
flying into stiff winds. As a safety precaution, they decided to fly
as close to the ground as possible. They were superb flyers, courageous,
but never foolhardy.</p>
<p>A signal was again displayed to notify the men at the Kill Devil
Hills Life Saving Station that further trials were intended. They
took the machine out of the hanger, and laid the 60-foot starting
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
track in a south-to-north direction on a smooth stretch of level
ground less than 100 feet west of the hanger and more than 1,000
feet north of Kill Devil Hill. They chose this location for the
trials because the ground had recently been covered with water, and
because it was so level that little preparation was necessary to lay
the track. Both the starting track and the machine resting on the
truck faced directly into the north wind. The restraining wire was
attached from the truck to the south end of the track.</p>

Brothers National Memorial Visitor Center.</p>
</div>
<p>Before the brothers were quite ready to fly the machine, John T.
Daniels, Willie S. Dough, and Adam D. Etheridge, personnel from
the Kill Devil Hills Life Saving Station, arrived to see the trials;
with them came William C. Brinkley of Manteo, and John T. Moore,
a boy from Nags Head. The right to the first trial belonged to
Orville; Wilbur had used his turn in the unsuccessful attempt on
December 14. Orville put his camera on a tripod before climbing
aboard the machine, and told Daniels to press the button when the
machine had risen directly in front of the camera.</p>
<p>After running the engine and propellers a few minutes, the take-off
attempt was ready. At 10:35 a.m., Orville lay prone on the
lower wing with hips in the cradle that operated the control mechanisms.
He released the restraining wire and the machine started
down the 60-foot track, traveling slowly into the headwind at about
7 or 8 miles an hour&mdash;so slow that Wilbur was able to run alongside
holding the right wing to balance the machine on the track.
After a run of 40 feet on the track, the machine took off. When
the airplane had risen about 2 feet above ground, Daniels snapped
the famous photograph of the conquest of the air. The plane then
climbed 10 feet into the sky, while Orville struggled with the controlling
mechanisms to keep it from rising too high in such an
irregular, gusty wind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>

<p class="pcap">The first flight.</p>
</div>
<p>Orville sought to fly a level flight course, though buffeted by the
strong headwind. However, when turning the rudder up or down,
the plane turned too far either way and flew an erratic up-and-down
course, first quickly rising about 10 feet, then suddenly darting close
to the ground. The first successful flight ended with a sudden dart
to the ground after having flown 120 feet from the take-off point
in 12 seconds time at a groundspeed of 6.8 miles an hour and an
airspeed of 30 miles an hour. In the words of Orville Wright:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This flight lasted only 12 seconds, but it was nevertheless the first in
the history of the world in which a machine carrying a man had raised
itself by its own power into the air in full flight, had sailed forward
without reduction of speed, and had finally landed at a point as high
as that from which it started.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Orville found that the new, almost untried, controlling mechanisms
operated more powerfully than the previous controls he had
used in gliders. He also learned that the front rudder was balanced
too near the center. Because of its tendency to turn itself when
started, the unfamiliar powered machine&rsquo;s front rudder turned more
than was necessary.</p>
<p>The airplane had been slightly damaged on landing. Quick repairs
were made. With the help of the onlookers, the machine was brought
back to the track and prepared for a second flight. Wilbur took
his turn at 11:20 a.m., and flew about 175 feet in about 12 seconds.
He also flew an up-and-down course, similar to the first flight, while
operating the unfamiliar controls. The speed over the ground during
the second flight was slightly faster than that of the first flight because
the winds were diminishing. The airplane was carried back to the
starting track and prepared for a third flight.</p>

</div>
<p>At 11:40 a.m., Orville made the third flight, flying a steadier
course than that of the two previous flights. All was going nicely
when a sudden gust of wind from the side lifted the airplane higher
by 12 to 15 feet, turning it sidewise in an alarming manner. With
the plane flying sidewise, Orville warped the wingtips to recover
lateral balance, and pointed the plane down to land as quickly as
possible. The new lateral control was more effective than he had
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
expected. The plane not only leveled off, but the wing that had been
high dropped more than he had intended, and it struck the ground
shortly before the plane landed. The third flight was about 200
feet in about 15 seconds.</p>

<p>Wilbur started on the fourth flight at noon. He flew the first
few hundred feet on an up-and-down course similar to the first two
flights. But after flying 300 feet from the take-off point, the airplane
was brought under control. The plane flew a fairly even
course for an additional 500 feet, with little undulation to disturb
its level flight. While in flight about 800 feet from the take-off
point, the airplane commenced pitching again, and, in one of its
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
darts downward, struck the ground. The fourth flight measured
852 feet over the ground; the time in the air was 59 seconds.</p>

</div>
<p>The four successful flights made on December 17 were short because
the Wrights, not desiring to fly a new machine at much height in
strong winds, sometimes found it impossible to correct the up-and-down
motion of the airplane before it struck the ground. Wilbur
remarked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who understand the real significance of the conditions under

<p>They carried the airplane back to camp and set it up a few feet
west of the hangar. While the Wrights and onlookers were discussing
the flights, a sudden gust of wind struck the plane and turned
it over a number of times, damaging it badly. The airplane could
not be repaired in time for any more flights that year; indeed, it
was never flown again. Daniels gained the dubious honor of becoming
the first airplane casualty when he was slightly scratched and
bruised while caught inside the machine between the wings in an
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
attempt to stop the plane as it rolled over. Subsequent events
were vivid in Daniels&rsquo; mind while reminiscing of his &ldquo;first&mdash;and
God help me&mdash;my last flight.&rdquo; He relates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I found myself caught in them wires and the machine blowing across
the beach heading for the ocean, landing first on one end and then
on the other, rolling over and over, and me getting more tangled up
in it all the time. I tell you, I was plumb scared. When the thing
did stop for half a second I nearly broke up every wire and upright
getting out of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Orville made this matter-of-fact entry in his diary: &ldquo;After dinner
we went to Kitty Hawk to send off telegram to M. W. While
there we called on Capt. and Mrs. Hobbs, Dr. Cogswell and the
station men.&rdquo; Toward evening that day Bishop Milton Wright in
Dayton received the telegram from his sons:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Success four flights Thursday morning all against twenty-one mile wind
started from level with engine power alone average speed through air
thirty-one miles longest 57 seconds inform press home Christmas.
Orevelle Wright.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the transmission of the telegram, 57 seconds was incorrectly
given for the 59-second record flight, and Orville&rsquo;s name was misspelled.
The Norfolk telegraph operator leaked the news to a local
paper, the <i>Virginian-Pilot</i>. The resulting story produced a series of
false reports as to the length and duration of the December 17 flights.
Practically none of the information contained in the telegram was
used, except that the Wrights had flown.</p>
<p>The Bishop gave out a biographical note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wilbur is 36, Orville 32, and they are as inseparable as twins. For
several years they have read up on aeronautics as a physician would
read his books, and they have studied, discussed, and experimented
together. Natural workmen, they have invented, constructed, and
operated their gliders, and finally their &lsquo;Wright Flyer,&rsquo; jointly, all at
their own personal expense. About equal credit is due each.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The world took little note of the Wrights&rsquo; tremendous achievement
and years passed before its full significance was realized.
After reading the Wrights&rsquo; telegram, the Associated Press representative
in Dayton remarked, &ldquo;Fifty-seven seconds, hey? If it had
been fifty-seven minutes then it might have been a news item.&rdquo;
Three years after the first flight an editorial appeared in the December
15, 1906, issue of the <i>Scientific American</i>, which included the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In all the history of invention, there is probably no parallel to the
unostentatious manner in which the Wright brothers of Dayton, Ohio,
ushered into the world their epoch-making invention of the first successful
aeroplane flying-machine.</p>

<h2 id="c14"><span class="small"><i>After the First Flight</i></span></h2>
<p>After 1903, the Wrights carved brilliant careers in aeronautics and
helped found the aviation industry. The successful flights made at
Kill Devil Hills in December 1903 encouraged them to make improvements
on a new plane called Flyer No. 2. About 100 flights
were flown near Dayton in 1904. These totaled only 45 minutes in
the air, although they made two 5-minute flights. Experimenting
chiefly with control and maneuver, many complete circuits of the
small flying field were made.</p>
<p>A new and improved plane, Flyer No. 3, was built in 1905. On
October 5 they made a record flight of 24&#8533; miles, while the plane
was in the air 38 minutes and 3 seconds. The era of the airplane
was well on the way. The lessons and successes at Kill Devil
Hills in December 1903 were fast making the crowded skies of the
Air Age possible.</p>
<p>Believing their invention was now perfected for practical use, the
Wrights wanted the United States Government to have a world
monopoly on their patents, and more important, on all the aerodynamic,
design, and pilotage secrets they knew relating to the airplane.
As early as 1905 they had received overtures from representatives
of foreign governments. The United States Army turned down their
first offers without making an effort to investigate whether the airplane
had been brought to a stage of practical operation. But disbelief
was on the wane. In February 1908 the United States War
Department made a contract with the brothers for an airplane.
Only 3 weeks later the Wrights closed a contract with a Frenchman
to form a syndicate for the rights to manufacture, sell, or license the
use of the Wright airplane in France.</p>

<p>During their Dayton experiments, the Wrights had continued to
pilot their airplanes while lying prone with hips in the cradle on the
lower wing. Now they adopted a different arrangement of the control
levers to be used in a sitting position and added a seat for a
passenger. The brothers brought their airplane to Kill Devil Hills
in April 1908 to practice handling the new arrangement of the control
levers. They wanted to be prepared for the public trials to be
made for the United States Government, near Washington, and for
the company in France.</p>
<p>They erected a new building at Kill Devil Hills to house the airplane
and to live in, because storms the year before had nearly demolished
their 1903 camp buildings. Between May 6 and May 14,
1908, the Wrights made 22 flights at their old testing grounds.
On May 14 the first flight with two men aboard a plane was made
near West Hill; Wilbur Wright being the pilot, and Charles Furnas,
a mechanic, the passenger. Orville and Furnas then made a flight
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
together of over 2 miles, passing between Kill Devil Hill and West
Hill, and turning north near the sound to circle Little Hill before
returning over the starting point close to their camp to land near
West Hill on the second lap.</p>

<p>Byron R. Newton, a newspaper reporter, was concealed in the
woods with other newsmen near camp to watch the Wrights fly.
Newton predicted in his diary just after seeing his first flight: &ldquo;Some
day Congress will erect a monument here to these Wrights.&rdquo;
Nineteen years later the Congress established the area as a National
Memorial.</p>
<p>Wilbur journeyed to France after completing the tests at Kill
Devil Hills, while Orville returned home to complete the construction
of an airplane for the United States Government. As Wilbur
set about methodically to assemble his airplane at Le Mans, some
125 miles from Paris, skeptics greeted the delay by accusing him of
bluffing. But Wilbur refused to hurry. &ldquo;<i>Le bluff continue</i>,&rdquo; cried a
Paris newspaper. However, when Wilbur took off on August 8,
circling the field to come in for a perfect landing, the crowd could
scarcely believe its eyes. Skeptics were confounded, and enthusiasm
was uproarious.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Wilbur&rsquo;s complete lack of conceit, together with his decency and
intelligence, won from the French people a hero-worship attitude,
while the press was unsparing in its praise and lamented having
called him a bluffer. The <i>Figaro</i> commented, &ldquo;It was not merely
a success but a triumph; a conclusive trial and a decisive victory for
aviation, the news of which will revolutionize scientific circles
throughout the world.&rdquo; It was a statement to the press by a witness,
Maj. B. F. S. Baden-Powell, president of the Aeronautical Society
of Great Britain, that is most often quoted: &ldquo;That Wilbur
Wright is in possession of a power which controls the fate of
nations is beyond dispute.&rdquo; One of Wilbur&rsquo;s sayings in France became
famous: &ldquo;I know of only one bird, the parrot, that talks,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and it can&rsquo;t fly very high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Orville&rsquo;s first public flight was on September 3, 1908 at Fort Myer.
He circled the field one and one-half times on the first test.
&ldquo;When the plane first rose,&rdquo; Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., recorded &ldquo;the
crowd&rsquo;s gasp of astonishment was not alone at the wonder of it, but
because it was so unexpected.&rdquo; Orville&rsquo;s final flight at Fort Myer
in 1908 ended in tragedy. The airplane crashed, killing Lt. Thomas
Selfridge, a passenger flying with Orville. Orville suffered broken
ribs, a fractured leg, and hip injuries.</p>
<p>In 1909, Orville completed the Government test flights by flying
10 miles in 14 minutes, or just under 43 miles an hour. The United
States Army formally accepted its first airplane from the Wrights on
August 2, 1909. During the same year both brothers made further
flying triumphs in Europe where they became famous flying in France
and Italy. While Orville was making sensational flights in Germany
(as required for the formation of a Wright company in that country),
Wilbur, in America, made spectacular flights at New York City
where more than a million New Yorkers got their first glimpse of
an airplane in the air.</p>
<p>Commercial companies were formed in France and Germany to manufacture
Wright planes before the Wright Company was organized
in the United States with Wilbur as president and Orville vice
president. In financial affairs the Wrights were remarkably shrewd&mdash;a
match for American and European businessmen. They grew
wealthy as well as famous, but they were not happy as businessmen
and looked forward to the time when they could retire to devote
themselves again to scientific research.</p>
<p>Orville returned to Kill Devil Hills in October 1911 to experiment
with an automatic control device and to make soaring flights
with a glider. The new device was not tested because of the presence
of newspapermen at the camp each day. Orville set a new
world&rsquo;s soaring record of 9 minutes and 45 seconds on October 24.
This remained the world&rsquo;s record until it was exceeded 10 years later
in Germany. On May 30, 1912, Wilbur Wright, aged 45, died of
typhoid fever. Orville survived him by 36 years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small"><i>The Original Airplane Exhibited</i></span></h2>
<p>Orville always thought that the National Museum in Washington,
administered by the Smithsonian Institution, was the logical place for
the original Wright 1903 airplane to be preserved and exhibited.
However, for a long time he was unwilling to entrust the airplane
there because of a controversy between him and the Smithsonian in
regard to the history of the invention of the airplane. In 1928,
Orville lent the plane to the Science Museum at South Kensington,
near London, England, with the understanding that it would
stay there permanently unless he made a written request for its return.
Finally, in 1942, the dispute with the Smithsonian was settled
to Orville&rsquo;s satisfaction, and the next year he wrote a request to the
Science Museum for the return of the airplane to this country when
it could be safely shipped after World War II ended.</p>
<p>After Orville Wright&rsquo;s death, on January 30, 1948, his executors
deposited the original 1903 airplane in the National Air Museum.
It was formally placed on exhibition on December 17, 1948, in
Washington, D.C., the 45th anniversary of the first flights. The
priceless original airplane now occupies the highest place of honor
among other interesting aeronautical exhibits.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small"><i>The National Memorial</i></span></h2>
<p>On March 2, 1927, the Congress authorized the establishment of
Kill Devil Hills Monument National Memorial to commemorate
the Wrights&rsquo; achievement of the first successful flight of a man-carrying,
power-driven, heavier-than-air machine. The area was transferred
from the War Department to the National Park Service, U.S.
Department of the Interior, on August 10, 1933, and on December
1, 1953, the name was changed to Wright Brothers National Memorial.
The memorial contains about 425 acres. It embraces the
actual site of the first four flights and the sites of most of the
glider experiments.</p>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small"><i>Guide to the Area</i></span></h2>
<h3>VISITOR CENTER.</h3>
<p>The visitor center represents the focal point in
the interpretation of the area. In addition to an extensive series of
modern museum exhibits telling the story of the memorial, the
center also houses an information desk, where literature is available,
and the administrative offices of the memorial. From the exhibition
rooms, there is a sweeping panoramic view of the reconstructed
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
Wright brothers&rsquo; 1903 camp, the first flight grounds where markers
designate the take-off and landing points of the first flights, and the
Wright memorial shaft atop Kill Devil Hill.</p>
<h3>RECONSTRUCTED WRIGHT BROTHERS&rsquo; 1903 CAMP.</h3>
<p>About 100 yards
southwest of the visitor center stand two wooden structures built by
the National Park Service in 1953 on the 50th anniversary of the
first flight. They are reconstructions of the Wright brothers&rsquo; 1903
living quarters and hangar based on historical research and photographs
of the originals. The furnishings within the living quarters
are of the 1902-3 period, and are almost exact duplications of those
used by the Wrights.</p>
<h3>FIRST FLIGHT GROUNDS.</h3>
<p>Less than 100 feet west of the camp is a
10-ton granite memorial boulder placed by the National Aeronautic
Association in 1928 on the 25th anniversary of the first flight. The
boulder marks the take-off point of the first flight and of the three
additional flights made December 17, 1903. A reconstruction of the
original single-rail starting track is placed at the north and south
sides of the boulder. Four numbered markers north of the boulder
designate landing points of the powered flights made on December
17, 1903.</p>
<h3>KILL DEVIL HILL.</h3>
<p>About a quarter of a mile south of the visitor center
lies Kill Devil Hill, used by the Wrights for gliding experiments
during the period 1900-1903. The north slope of this hill was also
used for the unsuccessful attempt at flight on December 14, 1903.
Before the Wright memorial shaft was erected, conservation work was
begun in 1929 on the massive 26-acre dune of shifting yellow sand
to anchor the 91-foot-high dune by seeding it with special grasses
adapted to sandy soil.</p>
<h3>WRIGHT MEMORIAL SHAFT.</h3>
<p>Atop Kill Devil Hill stands the striking
Wright memorial shaft, a triangular pylon 60 feet high, made
of gray granite from Mount Airy, N.C. Construction was begun February
4, 1931, and the shaft was dedicated November 19, 1932. Its
sides ornamented with outspread wings in bas-relief, the pylon gives
to the eye the impression of a gigantic bird about to take off into
space. Stairs lead to the top of the shaft and an observation platform
which offers a good view of the surrounding country&mdash;magnificent
dunes, the Atlantic Ocean, Albemarle Sound, and even West
Hill, a quarter of a mile west of the shaft, in the direction of the
sound. West Hill, the sand dune which was the scene of many of
the Wrights&rsquo; gliding experiments in 1901-3, was stabilized by the
National Park Service in 1934 to preserve the historic site.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
